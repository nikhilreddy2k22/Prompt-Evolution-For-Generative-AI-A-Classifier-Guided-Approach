# Prompt Evolution For Generative AI : A Classifier-Guided Approach
AI has taken over the IT industry with its ability to answer given questions more effectively than
search engines. The effectiveness depends on the prompt that the user provides. The prompt is the
text given by the user that contains what the user wants from the model in human-like language. The
more efficient and concise the prompt is, the more efficient the output. Our focus is on generative
AI. There are so many generative AI models out there on the internet. It is observed that the outputs
of these models do not precisely match the user inputs. This is mainly due to the large contexts and
understanding of the strength of the model and the ambiguity in the prompt, etc. To address this, we
introduce prompt evolution (the idea of regenerating outputs from the generative model, evaluating
the likeliness of the prompt and the output generated by the model, and choosing the top n from
the generated and evaluated outputs). We use the generative algorithm to generate the outputs by
considering the outputs of the current generation. We classify the outputs based on multi-objective
rather than single objectives, as the user may have more than one preference that needs to be
satisfied.
